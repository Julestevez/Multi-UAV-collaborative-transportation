# Multi-UAV-collaborative-transportation
Three quadrotors transport a particle mass payload with slung-cables. First approach is to create an equilateral formation with 3 UAVs, so that the payload is located under the centroid. The centroid is calculated with $x_c=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}}{3}$ and same for $y_c$.</br>
In following example, coded in 3D.py, the coordinates of 3 UAVs are $x_{1}=(0,0,50)$, $x_{2}=(0,5,50)$, and $x_{3}}$ is obtained through Pitagoras. The triangle side length is 5 and the length of each cable is 6.</br>
