# Multi-UAV-collaborative-transportation
Three quadrotors transport a particle mass payload with slung-cables. First approach is to create an equilateral formation with 3 UAVs, so that the payload is located under the centroid. The centroid is calculated with $x_c=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}}{3}$ and same for $y_c$.
